Hello! My name is Priyam and I am a Masters student in Statistics-Analytics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I earned my B.A. in Quantitiative Methods with a concentration in Neuroscience from Emory University where my focus was in Theoretical Statistcs, Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning.

### Why Research?

Research has always been my sandbox for exploration where I continue to learn new theory and have the opportunity to explore it in a real life problem. The coolest part of my field is my interests are spread pretty far, but this is because I enjoy bringing state-of-the-art tools and techniques to solve problems in other fields.
