Hello! My name is Priyam, and I am a Masters student in Statistics-Analytics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I earned my B.A. in Quantitative Methods with a concentration in Neuroscience from Emory University, where my focus was in Theoretical Statistics, Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning. 

My research is exploring multimodal and interdisciplinary applications of AI. Mainly I work with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Department of Environmental Engineering and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.
