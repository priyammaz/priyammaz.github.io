Hello! My name is Priyam and I am a Masters student in Statistics-Analytics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I earned my B.A. in Quantitiative Methods with a concentration in Neuroscience from Emory University where my focus was in Theoretical Statistcs, Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning.

## Why Research?

Research has always been my sandbox for exploration where I continue to learn new theory and have the opportunity to explore it in a real life problem. The coolest part of my research is my interests are spread pretty far, but this is because I enjoy bringing state-of-the-art tools and techniques to solve problems in other fields. So what are my interests?

### Computer Vision
My one passion is Photography, and our ability to capture photos dates back almost 200 years. It is only recently that advanced Deep Learning algorithms have gotten smart enough to gather detailed information from a scene and provide guidance based on it. The feasibility of Autonomous Vehicles have been driven by advancements in Vision and Perception and the ideas that have been developed up till now are being expanded into even more unique fields of Generative AI. From Computational Photography to AI Art, Computer Vision is at the heart of these advancements, and giving machines the ability to "see" will drive innovation.

### Speech Processing


### Environmental Engineering
