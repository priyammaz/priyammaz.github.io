Hello! My name is Priyam, and I am a Masters student in Statistics-Analytics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I earned my B.A. in Quantitative Methods with a concentration in Neuroscience from Emory University, where my focus was in Theoretical Statistics, Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning.

## Why Research?

Research has always been my sandbox for exploration, where I continue to learn new theory and have the opportunity to explore it in a real life problem. The coolest part of my research is my interests are spread pretty far, but this is because I enjoy bringing state-of-the-art tools and techniques to solve problems in other fields. So what are my interests?

### Computer Vision
My one passion is Photography, and our ability to capture photos dates back almost 200 years. It is only recently that advanced Deep Learning algorithms have gotten smart enough to gather detailed information from a scene and provide guidance based on it. The feasibility of Autonomous Vehicles have been driven by advancements in Vision and Perception, and the ideas that have been developed up till now are being expanded into even more unique fields of Generative AI. From Computational Photography to AI Art, Computer Vision is at the heart of these advancements, and giving machines the ability to "see" will drive innovation.

### Speech Processing
One of the most uniquely human features is language. Over thousands of years we have developed thousands of languages, each with unique dialects, and the construction of them is an art form. To add additional complexity to language, we can use speech to control our tone, inflection and intonation, to give the same series of words completely different meanings. Deep Learning has greatly increased our ability for speech processing whether it be Voice Synthesis, Music Transcription or Automatic Speech Recognition and exploration of this space will give machines another crucial and uniquely human ability. 

### Environmental Engineering
I have always placed an importance on protecting the natural environment and maintaining shrinking ecosystems. It was through my research I learned that I can leverage AI to build powerful and predictive models to better understand atmospheric sciences, the relations between humans and other organisms, and provide these types of analytics to low-resource areas. I can tell over my years of being a wildlife photographer how things are shifting for many animal populations, and I hope to do everything I can to fight against the destruction of their environment.
